# Agenda

1. Demonstration of multi-tenancy proof-of-concept - Eli Zoller

2. Discussion and next steps

# Attendees
* Eli Zoller
* Brandon Weigel
* Daniel
* Mellissa Anez
* Williow Gillngham
* Nat Kanthan
* Kendalyn Banks

### Next Steps/Action Items
* Setup - Document basic multi site setup - https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1438
* Fedora Access Control - Drupal Site based access to Fedora containers - https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1437
* Solr - Highest priority is sorting out the Solr stuff (ability to index multiple sites into one site) - https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1300
* Blzegraph - Ability to separate/filter for one site content in Blazegraph - https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/805 (We should also have the ability to search all the content from multi sites)


## Notes from Eli

## Minutes
### Proof of Concept Multi-Site

#### Two approaches to setup multi-site
* Spinning up multiple islandora playbooks with certain functions enable
* Spinning up 1 islandora vm and two drupalvms with islandora modules installed (no other services)
For both setup, manual configurations changes are noted.  In Eli's setup, he used the same key to generate the jwt tokens.  

#### Verified functionality
##### Fedora
* Able to speak to single fedora in multiple roots
* However, different containers do not have any access control.  

##### Solr
* Able to index and search to its own individual core
* able to index to multiple solr cores on the same solr
* Confirm if multisite document will work for the aggregated search or if we need to use the solr documents
* Drupal Solr API 3? has introduced [SolrMultisiteDocument](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/search-api-solr/search-api-solr-howtos/set-up-and-configure-a-multisite-search).  This allows from content from one site to be shown/searched from another site.  But, we are not able to search and browse both sites content at once or as an aggregate.  This is the major challange we are facing now.
* Though the Cores are separate, the indexes are differnt or have different ids, and all the content could not be searched/viewed as one.  

* Eli to further explore Solr Document vs SolrMultisiteDocument to get all different site content indexed into one index.  
* Brandon noted that content needs to be returned as fields so that users can use the full power of the Drupal features to show cases the content in a common site.  The users may want an html representation as well.

##### Blzegraph
* Able to write to shared blazegraph
* We may want to consider writing to different namespaces or adding a mechanism to filter triples per site.  We also want to search all triples/content from all the sites.

* Blazegraph has a notion of namespaces
* But it’d be a similar thing to solr where you would need individual namespaces and a shared namespace
* Or a way to “filter” the query by a particular site

##### Microservices
* Able to write to a single gemini db
* Able to use one Microservices server for all multi sites
* FITs need some manual configuration - This PR: https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook/pull/162 can help address that.

##### Auth - would they need the same JWT token? (thats what i did for now)
Maybe could add a piece to the ansible role to create the keys on the other servers and place them back on the tomcat server
Would you want each site to have its own token? Follow up with other folks

##### Deployment 
* Users will want to deploy multi-site out of the box 
* Users will want to add a site after deployment

* We need to document and support both of the above use cases.
