# Agenda

1. Discussion: https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1300
  * Outline of the plan
  * What's missing?
    * Official recommendation to all Islandora developers: configuration options should be surfaced as Drupal variables, instead of database-stored configurations, to enable simple multi-site settings.php overrides (Brad)
  * Next steps?
